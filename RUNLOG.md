# Overnight tuning log — CLP FY25 on gpt-5.6-luna (pure Luna, updater + reviewer)

Scoring vs the Fable-verified ground truth (`CLP Model FY25 (Updated).xlsx`, 690
evaluated cells in the 2025 column). "Correct" = evaluated value within
max(1.0, 0.5%). Criteria: balanced (Final!AI99=0) · full rollover · ≥90% correct ·
≤60 min · every uncertain cell red-flagged.

| Run | When (UTC) | Runtime | Correct % | Balance gap | Wrong-unflagged | Wrong-flagged | Outcome / major errors |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 12 (baseline) | 08-11 12:15 | 45m | 68.8% | 250 | 172 (mostly propagation from ~15 root inputs) | 43 | Gate blocked delivery. Roots: BS composite rows misread, cash column-misread, MI composition missed, SoC 5-yr table gaps, net finance costs LLM-mapped wrong. |
| 13 | 08-11 13:08 | 46m | 68.3% | 130 | 171 | 48 | First DELIVERED workbook (with exceptions). Major errors: rescue pass skipped (mapping consults ate the time budget — reordered for r14); post-gate crash in reviewer dump (RGB serialization — fixed); P&L composition roots persist (net finance costs, NCI split, one-offs bridge). |
| 14 | — | — | — | — | — | — | Rescue-first ordering; graduated label+prior matching (fixes net finance costs); signed self-corroborating composition rules; reviewer crash fix. |

## Fix history feeding these runs
- r1–r2: API dialect + reasoning-budget escalation (plumbing)
- r3–r8: extraction schema discipline, tie self-check, quarantine, empty windows
- r9–r10: full pipeline reached; style-copy bug; mapping pacing (budget + walk-away)
- r11: first integrity-gate verdict (balance 18,241; 113 flags)
- r12: corroboration-gated cascade, consensus dedup, sign-flip, recompose → gap 250
- r13: targeted rescue (5/6 on hardest rows in live test), always-flag LLM, tiered gate
